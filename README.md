## Elizar Aitbek's Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio project! It's built with **React** and **TypeScript**, because why not make things _look good_ and _break less_ at the same time?

---

## Introduction

Hello there! I'm **Elizar Aitbek**, a web developer who turns _coffee_ into **code** and bugs into... well, more _learning experiences_.

If you find any bugs in my code, itâ€™s probably just a feature in disguise. ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/ElizarAitbek/portfolio.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd portfolio`

3. Install the dependencies:  
   `npm install`

4. Run the app locally:  
   `npm run dev`

Now you're ready to see my portfolio in action! **Warning**: May cause sudden urges to hire a great developer.
